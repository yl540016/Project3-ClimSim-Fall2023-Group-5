+ Project summary:  ClimSim is an ongoing machine learning research project of LEAP (Learning the Earth with AI and Physics) Center. In this project, we try to first reproduce the quickstart demo notebook in the local computer and second created new machine learning model based on ClimSim. In the first challenge, we create a report which document reproduction steps and encountered issues for the full reproduction process. In the second challenge, we create a new CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model based on ClimSim dataset, which can offer more solutions for the baseline models in ClimSim. We also implemented the quickstart notebook on Google Colab, which can help future users to reproduce notebook and be familiar with the dataset more easily.
