### Code lib Folder

The lib directory contains various files with function definitions (but only function definitions - no code that actually runs).

The lib directory contains :
- 1. Our group's CNN model file (.pth file)
- 2. Jupyter Notebook file that contains the codes that implement and save our CNN model.
