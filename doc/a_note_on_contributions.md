## Project 3

**Team members**: Yoojin Lee, Zhaolin Wang, Shaohuan Wu, Yufei Wang, Nashita Rahman, Haoyu Wang

**Summary**: ClimSim is an ongoing machine learning research project of LEAP (Learning the Earth with AI and Physics) Center. In this project, we try to first reproduce the quickstart demo notebook in the local computer and second created new machine learning model based on ClimSim. In the first challenge, we create a report which document reproduction steps and encountered issues for the full reproduction process. In the second challenge, we create a new CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model based on ClimSim dataset, which can offer more solutions for the baseline models in ClimSim. We also implemented the quickstart notebook on Google Colab, which can help future users to reproduce notebook and be familiar with the dataset more easily.

**[Contribution Statement]** 
-  Yoojin Lee: Wrote the report for Challenge 1. Provided instructions in a Python Notebook when implementing the ClimSim notebook. Produced, revised, and finalized the notebook file. Evaluated models, created visualized plots, and compared them using four evaluation metrics with validation and scoring data. Wrote the README, put everyone’s work together and uploaded them in GitHub.

- Zhaolin Wang: Wrote the report for Challenge 1. Set the environment and mounted Google Drive to the /content/drive directory on the Colab. Trained and saved CNN models.  Created visualized plots and evaluated with scoring data. Wrote explainations and documentation about CNN model.

- Shaohuan Wu: Wrote the report for Challenge 1. Implemented the quickstart notebook on Google Colab by using Google Drive. Assisted in organizing github files and wrote the project summary.

- Yufei Wang: Wrote the report for Challenge 1.
